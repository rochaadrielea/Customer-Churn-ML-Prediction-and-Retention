# Customer Churn ML Prediction and Retention

## Overview
This project aims to analyze customer churn for a business using **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques. The goal is to predict which customers are likely to leave and provide insights to improve retention strategies. The dataset used contains customer demographics, subscription details, and behavioral data.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn
- **Model Deployment:** Streamlit (optional for dashboard)
- **Data Storage & Querying:** SQL (for structured queries and data retrieval)

## Workflow
1. **Data Understanding & Cleaning**
   - Load and inspect the dataset
   - Handle missing values and duplicates
   - Convert categorical variables into numerical representations
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find patterns
   
2. **Feature Engineering & Preprocessing**
   - Select key features for prediction (e.g., tenure, contract type, monthly charges)
   - Normalize/scale numerical values
   - Split dataset into training and testing sets

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Implement a classification model (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost)
   - Train the model on customer data
   - Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters for better results

4. **Prediction & Insights**
   - Apply the model to predict customer churn
   - Analyze key drivers of churn (e.g., high monthly charges, short tenure)
   - Suggest actionable strategies to reduce churn

5. **Visualization & Dashboard (Optional)**
   - Create charts showing customer segments and churn probabilities
   - Deploy a dashboard using Streamlit or Power BI for business users

## Outcome
- **Predictive Model:** A trained ML model that predicts customer churn probability.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Identified key risk factors contributing to churn.
- **Retention Strategy Recommendations:** Actionable steps businesses can take to improve customer retention.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** (Optional) Visual interface for business teams to explore customer churn trends.
